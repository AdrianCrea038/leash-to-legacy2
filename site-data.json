    "texto": "We are so glad you stopped by our webpage! Our main goal is to make you and your pup a better functioning, safe team. We begin our instruction in your home. This allows me to see your house and dog in action. We will discuss your ideas and what you want from our sessions. We can start in the first session with beginning commands: sit, down, touch/boop. From there, we can create a teaching schedule the whole family can be part of. Learning for a dog can have its limitations as a human learning, patience, and repetition. I was taught Positive Reinforcement; this is safer and keeps your dog attentive. Reach out on our contact page, and I will get back with you! You are going to make a great team!"
